# Ferny's React Portfolio


## Description

Built with React JS, My personal portfolio is a web app online resume where I showcase my skills, projects, and accomplishments.
The portfolio looks modern and cool, and it shows that Im good at creating websites.
People who visit the portfolio can check out my work, read about me, and easily get in touch with me if they want to work together.
The website is easy to use and looks great on any device. Its a way for me to show off what I can do as a developer!

```javascript
GIVEN a single-page application portfolio for a web developer

WHEN I load the portfolio
THEN I am presented with a page containing a header, a section for content, and a footer.

WHEN I view the header
THEN I am presented with the developers name and navigation with titles corresponding to different sections of the portfolio.

WHEN I view the navigation titles
THEN I am presented with the titles About Me, Portfolio, Contact, and Resume, and the title corresponding to the current section is highlighted.

WHEN I click on a navigation title
THEN I am presented with the corresponding section below the navigation without the page reloading and that title is highlighted.

WHEN I load the portfolio the first time
THEN the About Me title and section are selected by default.

WHEN I am presented with the About Me section
THEN I see a recent photo or avatar of the developer and a short bio about them.

WHEN I am presented with the Portfolio section
THEN I see titled images of six of the developerâ€™s applications with links to both the deployed applications and the corresponding GitHub repositories.

WHEN I am presented with the Contact section
THEN I see a contact form with fields for a name, an email address, and a message.

WHEN I move my cursor out of one of the form fields without entering text
THEN I receive a notification that this field is required.

WHEN I enter text into the email address field
THEN I receive a notification if I have entered an invalid email address.

WHEN I am presented with the Resume section
THEN I see a link to a downloadable resume and a list of the developerâ€™s proficiencies.

WHEN I view the footer
THEN I am presented with text or icon links to the developerâ€™s GitHub and LinkedIn profiles, and their profile on a third platform (Stack Overflow, Twitter)

### Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

`` npm start ``
Runs the app in the development mode.
Open <http://localhost:3000> to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

`` npm test ``
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the section about running tests for more information.

`` npm run build ``
Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about deployment for more information.

`` npm run eject ``
Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `` eject ``, you can't go back!

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `` eject `` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `` eject ``. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
